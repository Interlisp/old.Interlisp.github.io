<h2>What is Medley Interlisp?</h2>

<p>Medley Interlisp is the environment originally developed for the  Xerox Lisp
  machines (called D-machines, names Dorado, Dolphin, Dandelion, Daybreak).
  The project was spun out to a company called Envos, which then
turned into Venue.</p>
<p> It was the first IDE with a window/mouse/menu GUI, launched as a product from Xerox
in 1980. It was a base from which AI
applications were built, as well as a research project in its own
right.</p>

<p>  For example, Interlisp SEDIT is the canonical ancestral
  structure editors. Masterscope and the "file package" included
  system-management tools that combined features of version control
  and build systems, with comprehensive cross referencing support.</p>

<p>Medley was the latest release of the Xerox Lisp environment, before
the whole environment was renamed Medley. It was originally written in
Interlisp (a dialect separate from the MACLISP/Common Lisp tradition,
with its own ancestry), but later, Common Lisp also became part of the
environment. Medley includes a WYSIWYG text editor (TEdit), email
organizer (Lafite), performance tools (Spy) and many other libraries
and user contributed code (from the 1980s).</p>

<h2>About the Medley Interlisp Project</h2>
<p>Our aim is to restore Medley Interlisp to usability on modern
  systems, sufficient to allow someone to develop some code and
  experience what it was like.  You could think of this as a kind of
  "vintage software" project, to try to capture the sense of fluidity
  in the development cycle.  We hope to provide a platform for
  demonstration of early experiments of hypertext (Notecards), Desktop
  management (Rooms), Object-oriented programming (LOOPS), as well as
  Interlisp itself.</p>

Masinter</a>, Ron Kaplan, Nick Briggs, Wayne Marci, Paul McJones, Bruce Mitchener, John

please join
in. See <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley/issues"> GitHub
issues</a> for some ideas.
<p>Weâ€™re meeting weekly (Monday 10:30am PT) via zoom.</p>

<p>We're hoping to make some demos of various features but could use
some help. We're  coordinating with the Computer History Museum and
would like to with the ACM History group, the Internet Archive, Fuji Xerox and PARC.</p>
		
<h2>Basic components</h2>

<p>An implementation of the virtual machine (like a port of the microcode that turned the Xerox hardware into a lisp machine.) The emulator, called <strong>maiko</strong>, was  initially developed at Fuji Xerox for the SunOS/SPARC. It was subsequently ported to many different OS and hardware combinations. </p>

<p>The Lisp system itself was split into layered parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The core of the system written in Lisp to implement system components including memory management, Interlisp and Common Lisp interpreters and compilers.</li>
  <li>Basic operating system components: thread scheduler, drivers for disk, floppy, display, keyboard; windows, menus, fonts, networking (originally PUP, then XNS, then TCP/IP).</li>
  <li>The <strong>Library</strong> contains additional utilities and the development environment, text editor (TEdit), debugger, source file manager, email client,etc.</li>
<li><strong>LispUsers</strong> packages were contributed by users but curated by the Interlisp developer group</li>
<li>Raster image <strong>Fonts</strong> in display and print resolution</li>
<li>Documentation and release notes</li>
<li>Memory images (<strong>sysouts</strong>) that can be loaded run without loading or compiling anything other than compatible maiko.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GitHub integration</h2>

There is a GitHub Organization <a href="https://github.com/interlisp">Interlisp</a> with
repositories for <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/maiko">Maiko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley">Medley</a>, this
web site (Interlisp.github.io) and others. The <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley/wiki">Wiki</a>, <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley/releases">Releases</a>, <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley/issues">Issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley/discussions">Discussions</a>,
are all under the <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley">Medley repository</a>.


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary focus of this project is to make Medley usable enough that people can use it in a modern environment. Primarily this is a matter of testing and debugging; raise issues in the <a href="https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues">Interlisp/medley</a> repo. But we're also trying to "modernize" some things; for example, we're adding Unicode support for IO (Interlisp-D was built before Unicode, and supports an older Xerox encoding). As with most open source projects, what we're able to accomplish depends on volunteers.
  <ul>
    <li>See the <a href="https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/Guest-Book">Medley Interlisp Virtual Guest Book</a></li>
    <li>and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vROuZzj7UKCkUWVh0KK6jYM-rpyn2CFyALlC9GBfzb-XhY55XhToDn13km4Ye6YicbTr-v0V0ALbLK3/pub" target="new">Medley Project Goals</a> </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Releases</h2>
<p>
  We have yet to do any formal releases, but there are some samples in the <a href="https://github.com/interlisp/medley/releases">Medley repo</a>. Download the medley tgz and maiko for your host OS and architecture. Or build your own maiko following the build instructions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To facilitate revision, the History section of the web site has been moved. See
  <ul>
